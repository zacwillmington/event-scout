Requirements

- Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
- There should be 2 container components
- There should be 5 stateless components
- There should be 3 routes
- The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs; docs for v4 can be found here)

- Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
- Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
- Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!
