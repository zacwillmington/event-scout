Requirements

- Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
- There should be 2 container components
- There should be 5 stateless components
- There should be 3 routes
- The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs; docs for v4 can be found here)

- Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
- Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
- Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!

you can search for events, by liking thr event it saves it to you liked list.

maybe event on share on social media?
