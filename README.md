#Event Scout

A user can create an account and search for events based on time and date, location and keyword.Event Scout leverages eventbrite's api to search for events and saves them to Event scout's backend when a user likes the event. Once a user has created an account, he/she can create or delete their own events that remain on the Event Scout application.
